## This kit's copy

- **Git:** never commit, push or merge on your own. Follow the person's git-comfort setting and ask before each commit.
- **Show before you change:** before editing or creating any file (a new test file too), show the proposed diff or content and wait for a yes; if you can't ask, stop after proposing. Report evidence (the test output), never just "Fixed".
- **Packages only through the company mirror:** never add `<repositories>` to a POM, never use `@latest`, and never run `npx` or `go install` against the public internet. Ask before anything that downloads. Load `ai-sdlc-maven-via-artifactory` (if you have it) to find the mirror and the versions this repo uses.
- **Versions:** read the Jest version in `package.json` (Jest 29 and 30 differ in some defaults) and follow the repo's existing Jest config.

## Practices

### Test Structure
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.test.js` suffix
- Place test files next to the code they test or in a dedicated `__tests__` directory
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Use nested describe blocks to organize related tests
- Follow the pattern: `describe('Component/Function/Class', () => { it('should do something', () => {}) })`

### Effective Mocking
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.) to isolate your tests
- Use `jest.mock()` for module-level mocks
- Use `jest.spyOn()` for specific function mocks
- Use `mockImplementation()` or `mockReturnValue()` to define mock behavior
- Reset mocks between tests with `jest.resetAllMocks()` in `afterEach`

### Testing Async Code
- Always return promises or use async/await syntax in tests
- Use `resolves`/`rejects` matchers for promises
- Set appropriate timeouts for slow tests with `jest.setTimeout()`

### Snapshot Testing
- Use snapshot tests for UI components or complex objects that change infrequently
- Keep snapshots small and focused
- Review snapshot changes carefully before committing

### Testing React Components
- Use React Testing Library over Enzyme for testing components
- Test user behavior and component accessibility
- Query elements by accessibility roles, labels, or text content
- Use `userEvent` over `fireEvent` for more realistic user interactions

## Common Jest Matchers
- Basic: `expect(value).toBe(expected)`, `expect(value).toEqual(expected)`
- Truthiness: `expect(value).toBeTruthy()`, `expect(value).toBeFalsy()`
- Numbers: `expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3)`, `expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(3)`
- Strings: `expect(value).toMatch(/pattern/)`, `expect(value).toContain('substring')`
- Arrays: `expect(array).toContain(item)`, `expect(array).toHaveLength(3)`
- Objects: `expect(object).toHaveProperty('key', value)`
- Exceptions: `expect(fn).toThrow()`, `expect(fn).toThrow(Error)`
- Mock functions: `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled()`, `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(arg1, arg2)`
